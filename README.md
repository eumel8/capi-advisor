# CAPI Advisor

A CLI tool to analyze Cluster API and Metal3 cluster components, check their conditions, build dependency trees, and provide clear advice on how to resolve any issues found.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Component Discovery**: Automatically discovers all Cluster API and Metal3 components in your cluster
- **Condition Analysis**: Analyzes all component conditions and identifies issues
- **Dependency Tree Building**: Builds hierarchical dependency relationships between components
- **Intelligent Advisory System**: Provides specific recommendations for resolving issues
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Supports human-readable reports, JSON, and YAML output
- **Focused Health Diagnostics**: Dedicated doctor mode for quick health checks

## Supported Components

- **Cluster API Core**: Clusters, Machines, MachineSets, MachineDeployments
- **Control Plane**: KubeadmControlPlane, KubeadmConfig
- **Metal3 Infrastructure**: Metal3Cluster, Metal3Machine, BareMetalHost

## Installation

```bash
go build -o capi-advisor .
```

## Usage

### Comprehensive Analysis

Get a full analysis with recommendations for all components:

```bash
# Analyze all components across all namespaces
./capi-advisor analyze

# Analyze components in a specific namespace
./capi-advisor analyze -n cluster-system

# Analyze a specific CAPI cluster
./capi-advisor analyze -c my-cluster

# Show dependency tree along with analysis
./capi-advisor analyze --tree

# Get results in JSON format
./capi-advisor analyze -o json
```

### Health Diagnostics

Focus on health issues and their solutions:

```bash
# Run health diagnostics
./capi-advisor doctor

# Check specific namespace
./capi-advisor doctor -n cluster-system

# Check specific CAPI cluster
./capi-advisor doctor -c my-cluster
```

### Dependency Tree View

Visualize component relationships:

```bash
# Show component dependency tree
./capi-advisor tree

# Focus on specific namespace
./capi-advisor tree -n cluster-system

# Show tree for specific CAPI cluster
./capi-advisor tree -c my-cluster
```

## Examples

### Example Output - Health Report

```
🏥 CLUSTER HEALTH REPORT
==================================================

Overall Health: ✅ Healthy

📊 COMPONENT SUMMARY
Total Components: 12
Status Distribution:
  ✅ Healthy: 10
  ⚠️ Degraded: 2
  ❌ Failed: 0

🚨 ISSUES FOUND
------------------------------

1. 🟡 Machine InfrastructureReady is False
   Component: Machine/worker-1
   Cause: Metal3Machine is not ready
   💡 Resolution: Check BareMetalHost status and provisioning
   🔗 Check these dependencies:
      ⏳ Metal3Machine/worker-1-metal3
      ❌ BareMetalHost/worker-1-bmh

2. 🟡 BareMetalHost Available is False
   Component: BareMetalHost/worker-1-bmh
   Cause: Host is not available for provisioning
   💡 Resolution: Check if host is powered on and BMC is accessible
```

### Example Output - Dependency Tree

```
🌳 COMPONENT DEPENDENCY TREE
============================
✅ Cluster/test-cluster (Healthy)
  ✓ Ready: Cluster is ready
  ✓ InfrastructureReady: Infrastructure is ready
  ✅ Metal3Cluster/test-cluster-metal3 (Healthy)
    ✓ Ready: Metal3Cluster is ready
  ✅ KubeadmControlPlane/test-cluster-control-plane (Healthy)
    ✓ Ready: Control plane is ready
    ✅ Machine/test-cluster-control-plane-abc123 (Healthy)
      ✓ Ready: Machine is ready
      ✅ Metal3Machine/test-cluster-control-plane-abc123-metal3 (Healthy)
        ✓ Ready: Metal3Machine is ready
        ✅ BareMetalHost/master-0 (Healthy)
          ✓ Ready: Host is ready and provisioned
```

## Architecture

The tool is structured into several key packages:

- `pkg/client`: Kubernetes client configuration and management
- `pkg/analyzer`: Component discovery and condition analysis
- `pkg/tree`: Dependency tree building and relationship mapping
- `pkg/advisor`: Knowledge base and issue resolution recommendations
- `cmd`: CLI commands and user interface

## Configuration

The tool uses your existing Kubernetes configuration:

1. In-cluster configuration (when running as a pod)
2. `~/.kube/config` file
3. `$KUBECONFIG` environment variable

## Contributing

This tool is designed to be extensible. To add support for new component types:

1. Add the component type to `SupportedGVKs` in `pkg/analyzer/discovery.go`
2. Add relationship logic in `pkg/tree/builder.go`
3. Add condition knowledge to the advisor in `pkg/advisor/advisor.go`
